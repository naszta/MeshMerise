# MeshMerise
C++ version the delaunay triangulation
This repo contains my first baby steps in the finite element method's world. 
My school project's goal was to write a simple mesh generator
For that I used a lot from Bl4ckbone.
For anyone interested: I am far from professional programmer and you will be probably better if you stick to Bl4ckbone's repo if you are
interested in Delaunay-triangulation.

In the near future I plan to expand my knowledge as well this project to be more FEM specific.
